## General Information
Ideal Pento Charto can help you with analyzing data and especially creating multiple charts - 
straight from given data or with transformations such as derivatives.

## Technologies Used
- Python version 3.4 and up
- NumPy 1.23.0
- Matplotlib 3.5.2
- Pandas 1.4.3
- Os for Python 3.9
- Glob for Python 3.9

## Features
- generate simple charts from given data
- calculate first and second derivative of given data
- generate first and second derivative charts
- editing data in specific column, eg. multiplying by constant

## Setup and Usage
Project works only for .txt documents for now.
1. Open Terminal and type:
`python3 main_code.py`
2. Drop the folder with all the project files in the directory with the folder with your
data.
3. Specify the folder name and columns from the files you want to use in the cofig file.
4. When you start the .py file, you will be presented with the list of files to be used. 
Data are presented in order: 1st line - title, 2nd and up lines - analyzed data; 1st 
column - X axis, 2nd and up columns - Y axis.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_.

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Current code works for files that consists only of title and data just below it (in second 
line). We are working on code that would work for all kinds of files, including those with 
more text in first few lines.
- Adding more possible formats of data (not just .txt)
