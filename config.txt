This is all you have configured!

first, choose your fighter [0, 1]
  normal chart = 1
  derivatives chart = 0
  quick data modification = 0

folder_name = folder

specify files if you wish to include only some specific ones
  files = 

columns, 1 or higher, column 0 is your x values, so don't enter 0
  from =
  to =

I normally suspect x axis and one or many data series in further files
  xaxis = 1
