This is all you have configured!

first, choose your fighter [0, 1]
  normal chart = 1
  derivatives chart = 0
  quick data modification = 0

folder_name = folder

specify files if you wish to include only some specific ones
  files = 

columns, 1 or higher, column 0 is your x values, so don't enter 0
  from =
  to =

I normally suspect x axis and one or many data series in all files [0, 1]
  xaxis = 1

do you want to limit range of your data?
  from_x = 1200
  to_x = 1800

invert x_axis? [0, 1] useful for IR
  invert = 1

want to highlight some points? do it like this: [x_value,y_column_index], [(...)], (...) you get the idea
  list_of_highlights = 

x axis name, default is 'data'
  y_name =
